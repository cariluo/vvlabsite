## Bootstrap Embedding
![be_picture](../images/research/bootstrap_pic.png){: width="50%"}

Embedding methods, broadly speaking, aim to reduce the cost of large quantum chemical calculations by treating different parts of a system with different levels of theory. Given the intrinsically local nature of electron correlation, each partition, or fragment, within the system may be treated with high-accuracy theories while the surrounding environment is handled by less expensive methods. From dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to density matrix embedding theory (DMET) and bootstrap embedding (BE), embedding techniques have proven themselves to be incomparably powerful tools for treating large chemical systems with both accuracy and efficiency. 

BE, a density matrix based embedding method developed by the Van Voorhis group, allows for an arbitrary chemical system to be partitioned into atom-centered overlapping fragments. Each fragment is embedded in an entangled bath, and the joint fragment-bath system is then treated at high-level of theory. Through the systematic construction of overlapping fragments, we enable the application of matching conditions across the independent fragment calculations. That is: sites which we expect to be poorly described within a fragment (so-called edge sites) are constrained to agree with sites which are described more accurately (so-called center sites). In this way, the calculation as a whole is able to “pull itself up by its bootstraps” - i.e., enforce internal self-consistency and ensure the entire system is treated on equal footing. 

Bootstrap Embedding began to see success with lattice models and simple molecular systems and has since developed into a reliable tool for accurately describing electron correlation in both molecular and periodic systems. Current work in our group focuses on 1) improving and applying Bootstrap Embedding codes to large systems in extended basis sets (e.g. metal-bound proteins and thin-layer defected materials) and 2) extending the method to state-of-the-art high-level fragment solvers to take full advantage of today's classical (e.g. via tensor network algorithms), and quantum (e.g. via variational quantum algorithms) computational resources. 


## Quantum Dots
[//]: # "TODO: Add a cool diagram / picture"
Our group investigates the geometry - electronic structure relationships of nanocrystals, especially colloidal quantum dots, in the ground and excited states. Implementation of nanocrystals in photovoltaic and photoemissive devices is hampered by mid-gap electronic states known as trap states, which are often associated with surface defects. Our group has investigated the nature and origin of these trap states in II-VI and III-V semiconductor nanocrystals, finding differing behavior in the two classes of materials, new types of trap states not previously described in these nanocrystals, and specific trends related to site coordination number, species, geometry, and electrostatic environment which influence trap presence and depth. We have further investigated how trap states are affected by surface reconstruction and how they are influenced by the presence of an inorganic shell.

Through collaboration with experimental groups at MIT and further afield, we have leveraged our expertise in nanocrystal electronic structure to study the geometry and ligand binding preferences of lead halide perovskite nanoplatelets and the X-ray photoelectron spectra of InGaP mesas. Moreover, we have developed a super-resolution technique known as the Broad Yet Narrow Description (BYND) for accurately simulating entire absorption spectra of large material systems at a fraction of the traditional cost. BYND does this by optimizing a highly approximate TD-DFT spectrum obtained with the Small Matrix Approximation (SMA) to fit a high accuracy but low resolution short time signal obtained from real-time TD-DFT. Along a similar vein, current work focuses on utilizing a kernel ridge regression to learn guess Hamiltonian - converged Hamiltonian mappings for specific systems to extend ab-intio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations for large systems to far longer timescales.
Most DFT studies of nanocrystals ignore thermal and ensemble effects, which precludes direct comparison with experimental absorption and emission spectra. The conventional method to generate thermally averaged spectra is the Nuclear Ensemble Approach (NEA), which requires extensive sampling and is prohibitively expensive for QDs beyond the ultrasmall regime. To address this issue, our group proposes a less resource-intensive approach: the Harmonic Approximation (HA), which assumes the electronic potential energy surfaces of QDs to be harmonic, with excited states having the same curvature as the ground state. Absorption spectra for QDs computed with the equilibrium HA accurately capture thermal broadening and Urbach band tailing, at a fraction of the cost of the NEA method.

We are also interested in examining exciton-phonon coupling, using the Huang-Rhys (HR) factor metric. Our findings suggest that the degree and effectiveness of surface passivation has a sizeable effect on the magnitude of exciton-phonon coupling. Successful passivation strategies for nanocrystals should not only minimize the number of trap states, but also reduce the spatial overlap between excitons and phonons, thereby lowering the HR factors.


## Quantum Computing
[//]: # "TODO: Add QM/QM/MM diagram after publication"
Quantum chemistry is a field promised to be revolutionized by the rapidly developing new paradigm of computation: quantum computing. Within electronic structure theory, quantum eigensolvers - such as quantum phase estimation (QPE) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) -  promise to enable alternate, more efficient pathways for calculating single-point energies of chemical Hamiltonians. Today's quantum computers, however, suffer from a number of severe limitations, earning them the common name of noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. NISQ computers suffer from a lack of noise resiliency and limited qubit count and coherence time, both of which serve to significantly restrain the depth and complexity of the circuits which can be executed reliably. All-in-all, this means that today's quantum algorithms are difficult (to say the least) to apply to the more realistic chemical systems one might be interested in.

Through our work with collaborators, we proposed a multiscale embedding approach that utilizes both quantum and classical computing resources. Starting from solvated protein complexes comprised of many atoms, we first choose a region of interest to treat on a quantum mechanical level. Then, within the quantum mechanical region, we use Bootstrap Embedding to partition the area into smaller chunks that produce smaller Hamiltonians amenable for near-term quantum devices. This results in a QM/QM/MM embedding that can efficiently exploit the capabilities of quantum computers to account for correlation effects. Other techniques in our papers allow fine-grained and systematic control over the required quantum resources and the target accuracy.

In related research, we work directly with simulated and real quantum computers to develop practical quantum algorithms tailored to the capabilities of modern NISQ devices. Quantum Bootstrap Embedding (QBE) is one such algorithm, in which each BE fragment may be loaded onto an independent quantum device and kept internally consistent via native bootstrap constraints: SWAP tests or single-qubit measurements. By coupling QBE to other state-of-the-art quantum algorithms developed by collaborators in both industry and academia - including hardware-efficient ansatz circuits, device-specific circuit transpilation/optimization, noise-resilient fermion-to-qubit encodings, and optimal measurement scheduling routines - we aim to produce some of the first evidence for the practical utility of quantum computation in quantum chemistry.
