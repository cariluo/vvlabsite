### About the Lab

The Van Voorhis group pushes the ability of electronic structure theory to capture important chemical information for increasingly large systems through the development of Bootstrap Embedding, investigates structure property relationships in nanocrystals to improve efficiency in photovoltaic and photoemissive devices, and has proposed a multiscale embedding approach with fine-grained and systematic control for quantum computing on near-term devices.
